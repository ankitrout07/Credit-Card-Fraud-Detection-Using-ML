# Credit Card Fraud Detection (Professional Edition)

This project provides a robust, modular, and professional implementation of fraud detection using multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate directories for backend, frontend, data, and services.
- **Handling Imbalance**: Uses **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address heavily skewed data.
- **Model Comparison**: Automated training and evaluation of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Deep Learning.
- **Real-time API**: Flask-based backend for serving predictions.
- **Premium Dashboard**: Adaptive dark-themed UI for manual transaction verification.
